Cause The Titanic through the radio!

The motivation of this project came from my interest in the radio issues that the Titanic, and other ships at that time, faced on their voyages. As we discussed in class, the early 1900s were a strange time for radio since there were little to no regulations in place. I wanted to create something that explains all these issues while still embracing some of the silliness of the situation. Because when learning about the decisions made for this to happen, its honestly silly in a way how people could truly make them.
Throughout the process of making this I actually learned a lot about radio during that time. The system that was being used, the spark radio from Marconi, had a lot of issues that I can’t even imagine having today. The main one being that everything was on one line. Lots of people could be listening and sending messages and this would cause jamming, as every person would be coming through on the line at the same time. This made it difficult in emergency situations, just like the Titanic, since people who are just casually using the line could be interrupting a call for help. Also, another quirk about this type of radio is that the loudness depended on the distance. So, when the Titanic was listening hard for a signal coming from land, the messages from the closest ship, The Californian, were outrageously loud. This led to the infamous situation where the Titanic told the Californian radio operator to shut up and get off the line, which actually was not uncommon for that time.
A thing that makes my project stand out is that you are actively trying to cause the Titanic. This means that you are forced to make all the wrong decisions and take notice of how much had to go wrong for the Titanic to happen. 
This project directly relates to this class because of how it explains the limitations in radio technology at the time, while also forcing you to make ethical decisions that go against what might be the obvious right thing to do. I want whoever plays this game to learn more about the radio issues that the Titanic faced and how the little decisions we make have such a big impact.
The main resource I used for making this game was the communication logs from the day of the Titanic. I read through all of the communications sent and received by the Titanic and based everything on that. I even put the approximate times that specific situations happened in the game so there is a sense of urgency as you play. I feel that as you play through the game, it actually becomes very dark as you feel a sense of impending doom. We all know how it’s going to end, it’s just you don’t know exactly how it will happen. 
The ending of my project is the most impactful part. As you go through the day, you can see how simple decisions would have changed the course of history. The ending makes you feel like so much more could have been done in the realm of radio and decision making to save lives.
